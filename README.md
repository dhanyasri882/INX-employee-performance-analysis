# INX-employee-performance-analysis
End-to-End Data Science Project using Machine Learning to analyze, understand, and predict employee performance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

INX Future Inc is a global data analytics and automation solutions provider.  
Recently, the company observed a decline in employee performance and an 8% drop in client satisfaction.

The management wanted a **data-driven solution** to understand the causes of performance decline **without negatively impacting employee morale**.

This project uses **Data Science and Machine Learning** to identify key performance drivers, build prediction models, and provide HR recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

• Analyze department-wise employee performance  
• Identify the top factors affecting employee performance  
• Build a machine learning model to predict performance  
• Provide business recommendations to improve performance  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains **1200 employee records** and **28 features**, including:

- Demographic information (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
- Job-related attributes (Department, Job Role, Job Level)
- Work experience and promotion history
- Workplace satisfaction and engagement metrics
- Employee performance ratings (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

Key observations from data exploration:

• Employee performance varies across departments  
• Most employees fall under the average performance category  
• Engagement and workplace satisfaction strongly influence performance  

---

## ⭐ Top 3 Factors Affecting Employee Performance

Using **Random Forest Feature Importance**, the most influential factors were:

1️⃣ **Last Salary Hike Percent**  
   Employees receiving higher salary hikes tend to perform better.

2️⃣ **Environment Satisfaction**  
   Workplace environment significantly impacts productivity.

3️⃣ **Years Since Last Promotion**  
   Long gaps in promotions reduce motivation and performance.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Three classification models were trained and evaluated:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline model |
| Random Forest | Final selected model |
| Gradient Boosting | Performance comparison |

### ✅ Final Model Selected: Random Forest
Reasons:
- Strong predictive performance  
- Handles complex feature relationships  
- Provides feature importance for interpretation  

---

## 📈 Model Outcome

The trained model can predict the **performance rating of new employees**  
based on their attributes, helping HR make better hiring decisions.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

Based on analysis and model insights:

1. Provide regular salary hikes and incentives  
2. Improve workplace environment and facilities  
3. Reduce long gaps between promotions  
4. Strengthen employee engagement initiatives  
5. Introduce mentoring and leadership programs  
6. Provide training and skill development programs  
7. Encourage work-life balance initiatives  
8. Implement performance recognition systems  
9. Use predictive analytics in hiring decisions  
10. Focus on employee retention strategies
